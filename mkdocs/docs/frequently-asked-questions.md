<summary>How do I update my documentation with the latest changes?</summary>
<br>
To keep your documentation up-to-date, you'll need to make changes to the `.md` files within the `docs` directory of your project. Once you're satisfied with the updates, run the command `mkdocs build` to generate the static files and replace the existing files in the output directory (e.g., `_site`). Finally, commit your changes using a version control system like Git and push them to your remote repository.
