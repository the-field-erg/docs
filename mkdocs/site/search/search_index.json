To use the search function, simply enter your query into the search bar located at the top right corner of the website. The results will be displayed in real-time to help you find the relevant information.  Is it possible to customize the appearance of the documentation?  Yes, MkDocs allows you to modify the theme and styling of your documentation easily. You can choose from various pre-built themes or create a custom theme by editing the CSS file located in the `docs` directory of your project.  Can I add code snippets to my documentation?  Absolutely! MkDocs supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages, making it easy for you to showcase code examples within your documentation. Simply wrap the code block with three backticks and specify the language using a hashtag symbol (e.g., ```python```).  How do I update my documentation with the latest changes?  To keep your documentation up-to-date, you'll need to make changes to the `.md` files within the `docs` directory of your project. Once you're satisfied with the updates, run the command `mkdocs build` to generate the static files and replace the existing files in the output directory (e.g., `_site`). Finally, commit your changes using a version control system like Git and push them to your remote repository."},{"location":"links/","title":"Links","text":"<p>Work In Progress</p> <p>Landing page Docs Markdown Guide</p>"},{"location":"mkdocs-install/","title":"MkDocs on Windows: Serving &amp; Building","text":"<p>Important Note: These instructions are applicable only if you intend to modify the content of this documentation website.
